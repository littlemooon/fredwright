# next-starter

Starter structure with full development setup - including linting, testing and type checking.

Some configuration is customised to my liking as this starter project is in active use by myself. I might split some of this into a cli util at some point, akin to react-scripts.

### clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/littlemooon/next-starter my-next-project
